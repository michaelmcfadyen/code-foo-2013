The file LetterSwap.java contains my solution for Backend Question 3.

To compile execute: 
```
javac LetterSwap.java 
```

Please ensure the file 'three-letter-words.txt' is in the same directory as the program.

To run the program use the command: 
```
java LetterSwap
```

The user will be prompted to enter two words. The start word and the end word. The program will then find a path between them.

The program outputs the path and the number of moves it takes. If no path is found the program will output accordingly.

Thanks,

Michael McFadyen
