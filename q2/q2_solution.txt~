How many gamers are in the San Francisco Bay Area? Describe each step in your thought process.

Firstly, this question is ambiguous as it does not give a clear definition of the term gamer, however I will take it as someone who interacts with any type of game (casual and hardcore).

The first step in this solution would be to find out how many people there are in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

1. The population is estimated to be 7.15 million (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area).

The second step would be to find the percentage of the population that are classed as gamers. To do this I will take the population of America(313,914,040) and the amount of americans that play video games (~211,500,000 according to a NPD report published on 05/09/2012, https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/pr_120905/) and work out the percentage of americans that play video games.

2. (211,500,000 / 313,914,040) * 100 = ~67.4%

If we assume that this percentage is applicable all over American we can work out how many gamers are roughly in the Bay Area.

3. 812,826 * (67.4 / 100) = ~549,470.4

So, there are roughly 549,470 gamers in the San Francisco Bay Area.
