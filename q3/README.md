My solution for Question 3 is in the file WordSearch.java.

To compile use the command:
```
javac WordSearch.java
```

Please ensure that the file word-search.txt is in the same directory as WordSearch.java

To execute the program use the command:
```
java WordSearch
```

The program will output the starting position and the direction in which it can be found if the word is contained in the wordsearch.
It will output "'word' not found" if not solution was found.

Thanks,
